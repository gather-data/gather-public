## What is Gather?

Gather is a powerful, customizable admin tool for customer support teams. Gather aggregates customer data, like charges from Stripe or order info from Shopify, and automates repetitive backend processes, like issuing refunds via Chargify or changing account information in your database. Gather is so easy to configure, any non-technical manager can build custom automations and data views in minutes to supercharge their team’s productivity.

## Why use Gather?

Gather unblocks customer support teams by empowering them to build the internal tools they need right now, instead of waiting for developer resources. For developers, Gather removes the burden of managing an entirely separate internal tool and building all of the process-based integrations, allowing them to get back to work on the product.

## Does Gather replace my helpdesk?

No, keep your favorite helpdesk to communicate with your customers! Gather is the link between your external communications and your internal processes. We help streamline those processes by aggregating data into a single view and automating your repetitive workflows, making the communication seamless.
