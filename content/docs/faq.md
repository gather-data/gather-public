## **General**

**What is Gather?**

Gather is a powerful, customizable admin tool for customer support teams. Gather aggregates customer data, like charges from Stripe or order info from Shopify, and automates repetitive backend processes, like issuing refunds via Chargify or changing account information in your database. Gather is so easy to configure, any non-technical manager can build custom automations and data views in minutes to supercharge their team’s productivity.

**Why use Gather?**

Gather unblocks customer support teams by empowering them to build the internal tools they need right now, instead of waiting for developer resources. For developers, Gather removes the burden of managing an entirely separate internal tool and building all of the process-based integrations, allowing them to get back to work on the product.

**Does Gather replace my helpdesk?**

**Does Gather integrate with other applications?**

Yes. We integrate with a wide range of partners including Zendesk, Stripe, Chargify, Slack, Salesforce, databases and more. Don’t see the one you need? Let us know at integrations@gatherdata.co. It could already be on our roadmap!

## **Set up**

**How do I get started?**

All you have to do is just sign up. You will get a free 14 day trial just by creating a new account. If you need any help, chat with us \[Link to Drift] or email us at sales@gatherdata.co.

**Do developers need to be involved?**

Only for set up - which should take 15 minutes for connections and maximum 1 hour for automations.

Setting up Connections: You will need an API key for 2 of our integrations: your own database and Chargify. All of our other supported integrations use OAuth. This means if you have the login for the connection you want to add, all you have to do is click a “connect” button.
