You can withdraw your consent from the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information by us at any time. However, if you choose to do so, we may not be able to provide you with the products and services you require.

What Information Do You Collect?

Where possible, we endeavor to collect information directly from you. We also collect information from third party sources who have obtained your consent to disclose such information to us. Lastly, we employ passive tracking technologies like many other companies for collecting information through our Service.

In order to use our Service, you may be required to provide us with certain information. If you do not provide us with such information, your access to or use of the Service may be limited.

Passive Tracking

Like many other websites, we may use third party analytics and passive tracking technologies to collect information from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Service, and the page or feature you requested. The data that we collect can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Service, and we can use that knowledge to make the Service better and more useful to as many users as possible. We do not track information about your online activity after you leave our Services.

“Cookies” are text files which are stored on your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Service are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. We also use cookies to engage in online behavioral advertising, also known as interest-based advertising, to better deliver you targeted offers that you might be interested in.
